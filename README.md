# 📚 Book Collection Application (Java)

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates basic object-oriented programming by managing a collection of books.

## 🔍 Overview

The program defines a `Book` class with the following attributes:
- `title`
- `author`
- `ISBN`

It also includes functionality to:
- Add books to a collection
- Remove books from the collection
- Display the list of books

## 🏗️ Structure

- `Book.java`: Defines the `Book` class with constructors and overrides for `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()`.
- `Library.java`: Handles the collection of books using an `ArrayList`.
- `Main.java`: Demonstrates adding, removing, and displaying books.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac Book.java Library.java Main.java
